We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Terms on the Services and updating the "Effective Date" above.

It is your responsibility to regularly review these Terms to stay informed of updates.

3. User Eligibility
By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age or have reached the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater, and have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts. If you are using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case "you" will refer to that entity.

4. Account Registration and Security
Certain features or services may require you to create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your account password and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach. We reserve the right to disable any account at any time for any reason, including if, in our opinion, you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms.

5. Products and Services
5.1 Product Descriptions
Chasethetics attempts to be as accurate as possible in describing our products and services. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other content is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by us is not as described, your sole remedy is to contact customer service for potential resolution at our discretion.

5.2 Pricing and Availability
All prices are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue any product or service without notice at any time. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services. All descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to change at any time without notice, at our sole discretion.

5.3 Order Acceptance and Cancellation
Your receipt of an order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We reserve the right to limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household, or per order.

6. Payment Terms

By submitting payment information, you grant us the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating payment. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any payment method you provide. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your account and payment method at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred.

7. Digital Products and Content
7.1 Nature of Digital Products
Certain products offered through our Services, including but not limited to fitness programs, meal plans, workout guides, transformation bundles, nutritional guides, instructional videos, and downloadable content (collectively, "Digital Products") are delivered in electronic format. These Digital Products represent educational materials, informational resources, and suggested guidelines developed based on general fitness principles.

7.2 No Guarantee of Results
You acknowledge and agree that Chasethetics makes no guarantees, representations, or warranties regarding specific results from the use of our Digital Products. Individual results may vary based on numerous factors including but not limited to genetics, body composition, metabolic rate, adherence level, pre-existing health conditions, dietary compliance, exercise consistency, sleep quality, stress levels, hormonal balance, lifestyle factors, environmental conditions, and individual effort. The testimonials, examples, and photos displayed on our Services are exceptional results, are not typical, and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results.

7.3 Educational Purpose Only
All Digital Products are provided for educational and informational purposes only. They are not medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment plans. The information contained in our Digital Products is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or before starting any fitness or nutrition program.

7.4 No Refund Policy for Digital Products
Due to the immediate digital nature and intellectual property characteristics of Digital Products, all sales of Digital Products are final and non-refundable. Once a Digital Product has been accessed, downloaded, or delivered to you, the transaction is considered complete. We do not provide refunds or exchanges for Digital Products under any circumstances, including but not limited to:

Change of mind or personal circumstances

Dissatisfaction with the product

Failure to achieve desired results

Technical difficulties on your end

Incompatibility with your devices

Time elapsed since purchase

Partial usage of the product

Failure to read product descriptions thoroughly

Misunderstanding of product nature

Buyer's remorse

The nature of digital content means that once access is provided, we cannot retract the information or intellectual property transferred. This no-refund policy is clearly stated at the point of purchase and by completing your purchase, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.

7.5 Limited Circumstances for Consideration
In extremely rare and exceptional circumstances at our sole discretion, we may consider providing store credit or alternative resolution for Digital Product purchases only when technical issues prevent access that are directly attributable to our systems and cannot be resolved through standard technical support. Such consideration is not guaranteed and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
